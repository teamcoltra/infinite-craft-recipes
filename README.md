# infinite-craft-recipes
A fruitless task of documenting every possible combination within the infinite combinations of neal.fun's infinite craft. I didn't enjoy the game as much just trying to combine things it was frustrating, however, it was a really fun task to code up a scraping tool which would try all the different combinations for me. I wound up just staring at the screen as it was popping up new words. 

## GAME FUNCTIONS
One of the main reasons I was building this was to create a game where it will give you the result and you need to find out how to make it. 

## HELP FUNCTIONS
I was going to create some code that helps you get the component parts of anything you want to make. However, it's very resource intensive and I think there has to be a better way. I also think PHP is probably not the right language for this, probably will take another crack at it in GoLang or something more efficent. I would love to see anyone else's work on this. 

## SCRAPE
Initially I was going to include the code I used to scrape what I have but I was being very cautious with how I was hitting the server and I don't think it's a good idea to release what would basically become a DDoS tool against what is actually a great game.
